## UX
 
This website is for customers, to provide up to date, relevant and easily available information about the business and the services it provides.
The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly platform that both new and existing customers can use for a range of purposes which were
identified through research, from the perspective of the business and user perspective.
### Strategy


### Structure
Through target audience research and discussions with Lomasney Motors, it was decided to create a one page scrolling website that incorporates 5 different sections
with minimal text and vivid images. These sections were identified as the key pieces of information sought after by customers of the business and potential customers.

#### Images

### User Stories

* As the owner of Lomasney Motors, I would like to develop a stronger online presence, so that I can expand my customer base while also sustaining open communication with my existing customers.

* As the owner I would like to provide basic company and service information to cut down on the amount of time spent on the phone during the working day as we only have one other member of staff currently employed and that time needs to be spent on the services and repairs.

* As an employee, I would like to provide up to date and informative content about our services to our existing customers and attract new customers by making the business more easily accessible.

* As a new user, I would like to know more about the company and what they offer so that I can see if I would be able to develop a rapport with them as this will be a service I will need on a regular basis.

* As a new user, I would like to know what services they offer and the prices of these services.

* As a new user I would like to see customer reviews of the service and the business so that I can determine the level of quality of the service. This service is important and I need to know that the company are trustworthy and professional.

* As a new user, I would like to see where they are located as I am new to the area and need to have this service within close proximity to where I live.

* As a potential user, I would like to be able to contact the business online as I have a very busy schedule and do not have alot of free time to call.

* As a potenial user I would like to be able to book in for a service online in advance to save time.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features
The website was built as a one page scrolling website that includes 5 different sections of one page each
 - General (navbar, logo, footer, social links, directions link, opening hours)
 - Home Page ( hero image, request a quote call to action)
 - About Section (paragraph about company, images, location)
 - Services Section (Images, services provided)
 - Testimonials Section (reviews from customers, star rating, leave a review button)
 - Contact Us Section(contact form, opening hours, map)

 
### Existing Features

#### Navbar & footer
 The Navbar and footer are both in a fixed position to make it easy for users to access the navigation elements of the
 website and always have constant accessibility to social, direction and phone links. The navbar consists of logo text 
 to the left and navigation links to the right, the navbar is responsive and it's menu collapses into a hamburger menu 
 for both tablet and mobile devices.
 The footer consists of opening hours and copyright information to the left and links to social media, telephone and 
 direction information on the right.

#### Home Page
 The Hompage was designed to be a visual display with minimal text, it includes a hero image, a brief description highlighting 
 the main services the company provide which is jumbotron displayed over the hero image and a call to action button which provides
 a link to the contact form once clicked. The idea of the homepage is to visually entice the user while not bombarding them with an 
 overload of text to consume.

#### About Page
The About page is set up as a two column grid display with the left side displaying three small paragraphs of text detailing a brief 
history and background of the business and a full width image of the owner and company signage to the right. I decided to use this image 
as it represents what the company is about, a family run local garage.

### Services Page
The services page is a 3 column display of images with a text overlay decribing the services the company offer. There is an image to 
represent each service with a total of 9 services and correpsonding images displayed. In mobile view this has been reduced to one column 
with each service displayed as a block element, with one after the other.

#### Testimonials Page
The testimonials page was designed using a Bootstrap carousel slider which runs automatically showcasing customer reviews. In larger screen sizes
a call to action button with the caption 'Leave a Review' has been added which when clicked opens a modal dialog box for users to write a review and submit it.

#### Contact Us Page 
The contact us section is a two column page that includes a contact form on the left hand column and to the right I have included the business address, opening hours
and a basic map image showing the location of Lomasney Motors.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
## Issues
- Navbar background color
- Navbar toggle menu collapsing
- Carousel slides overlapping
- Contact Image not fully covering section

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

### Content
- The text for the 'About Us', 'Meet the Team' and Services section were obtained from Dermot Lomasney, Cillian McCarthy, 
the owner and employee at Lomasney Motors and some text was added by me from my knowledge of the business and the surrounding area of Midleton.
The testimonials content was taken from the company Facebook review section and also reviews from Google.

### Media
- The photos used in this site were obtained from Basil Alrawi, who I enlisted to take some quality photos for the website.

### Acknowledgements

- My inspiration for this project came from my Dad. He is the owner of Lomasney Motors since 1987 and the business has never had a website.
  He has many regular customers, however as society has changed alot in the last 30 years, Midleton has now a much bigger population and the
  surrounding area has grown exponentially. It is important today for any business to have an online presence as customers will now 
  search online to find the service they are looking for. I have seen the business Lomasney Motors go from strength to strength during the 
  recession and the covid 19 pandemic. Now more than ever I thought it would be a good idea to put my skills to some real \
  life use and build a simple yet effective website that will allow the business to expand its customer base and showcase what the services they offer.
