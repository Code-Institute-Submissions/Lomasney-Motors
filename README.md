## **UX Design**
---
This website is for customers, to provide up to date, relevant and easily available information about the business and the services it provides.
The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly platform that both new and existing customers can use for a range of purposes which were
identified through research, from the perspective of the business and user perspective.

### **_User Stories_**

* As the owner of Lomasney Motors, I would like to develop a stronger online presence, so that I can expand my customer base while also sustaining open communication with my existing customers.

* As the owner I would like to provide basic company and service information to cut down on the amount of time spent on the phone during the working day as we only have one other member of staff currently employed and that time needs to be spent on the services and repairs.

* As an employee, I would like to provide up to date and informative content about our services to our existing customers and attract new customers by making the business more easily accessible.

* As a new user, I would like to know more about the company and what they offer so that I can see if I would be able to develop a rapport with them as this will be a service I will need on a regular basis.

* As a new user, I would like to know what services they offer and the prices of these services.

* As a new user I would like to see customer reviews of the service and the business so that I can determine the level of quality of the service. This service is important and I need to know that the company are trustworthy and professional.

* As a new user, I would like to see where they are located as I am new to the area and need to have this service within close proximity to where I live.

* As a potential user, I would like to be able to contact the business online as I have a very busy schedule and do not have a lot of free time to call.

* As a potential user I would like to be able to book in for a service online in advance to save time.

### **_Strategy_**
My goal for this project was to design a user-friendly website focused on easily accessible key information for users and 
communicate with the business online. My goal was to create an online platform for the business to build brand 
awareness and showcase their work. The design was intended to be easy to navigate with a simple design and plenty of vivid imagery.

### **_Scope_**
The focus of the project, given the time frame and my current skills, was to develop a one page scrolling website with 5 main sections
that users could easily navigate and provide information that was concise and relevant, provide a means of online communication through 
the use of a contact form and review modal, and a clear description of the services provided. It was important to include a brief background 
on the company and team as it is a local business, it is the personal service they offer that sets them apart from bigger companies.  

### **_Structure_**
The website is designed to entice the users through plenty of vivid images and short paragraphs of concise, relevant information that
do not bombard the user with an overload of information. The services offered are displayed as images with large captions of the service provided.
Call to action buttons are placed on 3 different sections to encourage the user to communicate if they wish to do so. The footer also 
provides external links to the Facebook page, google maps for directions and a link to the company phone number. The layout is simple,
and a fixed navigation bar allows the user to quickly navigate to any section no matter where they are on the page.

### **_Skeleton_**
It is a one-page scrolling website with 5 different sections:
- Home Page
- About Section
- Meet the Team Section
- Services Section
- Testimonial Section
- Contact Section

#### **_Wireframe Mock Ups_**
- [Wireframes](wireframes/wireframes-alldevices.pdf)
- The final version of this website differs slightly from the wireframes in terms of some styling and layout elements.
- I decided to use a jumbotron on the landing page instead of including a 'Our Promise' Section as I felt it was 
  more appealing to the user.
- The services section had initially been designed as an icon with a description of the service underneath. This changed
  to having images displayed side by side and just a caption of the service name underneath each. I felt that a visual display of
  the services was far more compelling to a user than an overload of text explaining each one.
- The Team section also differs slightly in layout as initially I had the photo to the left of the card text but once I had previewed
  this while developing the website I decide to change this layout to make the images appears at the top of the card text as it looked 
  more visually appealing.

### **_Surface_**

#### **_Colours_**
- The colour scheme chosen for this project was based around the existing logo colours used by the company.
I used a mix of different shades of green and white for the body and backgrounds making sure to keep these colours muted so as not to distract from
any content or imagery. I used a yellow colour for the call to action buttons, so they would be vibrant and contrast with the other elements and the
yellow worked well with the green colours I had already chosen to use .

#### **_Typography_**
- The fonts chosen for this project were Lato and Montserrat. The Lato font was the closest font to the
logo which the company already have in place so it was important to keep this element throughout the website.
These fonts pair well together, are easy to read and give a professional look to the site.

#### **_Images_**
- Most of the images were created solely for the purpose of this website. These were obtained from Bazar Productions 
with some minor generic images taken from [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com) and [Pexel](https://www.pexel.com) 
where images were required for the services section.


## **Features**
---
The website was built as a one page scrolling website that includes 5 different sections.

### **Navigation Bar & Footer**
 The **navigation bar** is in a fixed position to make it easy for users to access the navigation elements of the website and allow them to 
 move from section to section as they wish. The navbar consists of **logo text** to the left which acts as a **link to the homepage** and 
 is always visible on screen. The **navigation links** are located to the far right, and provide scroll links to each section. The navbar 
 is responsive and the navigation menu collapses into a **hamburger menu** for both tablet and mobile devices.
 The **footer** includes **opening hours** details and **copyright information** to the left and links to **social media**, **telephone** and **direction** 
 information on the right. I initially had both the navbar and footer fixed however  I changed this design to the footer to cut down on 
 vertical space usage as it was obstructing content.

### **Home Page**
 The Home page was designed to be a visual display with minimal text, it includes a **hero image**, a brief description highlighting 
 the main services the company provide, which is jumbotron displayed over the hero image and a **call to action button**. This button provides
 a link to the contact form once clicked. The idea of the home page is to visually entice the user, while not bombarding them with an 
 overload of content to consume, keeping the design simple yet effective.

### **About Page**
The About page is set up as a two column grid display, with the left side displaying three small paragraphs of text detailing a brief 
history and background of the business, and a full width **image** of the owner and company signage to the right. I decided to use this image 
as it represents what the company is about, a family run local garage and enhances the personal feel of the business.

### **Services Page**
The services page is a 3 column display of **images**, with a text underneath stating the services the company offer. There is an image to 
represent each service, with a total of 9 services and corresponding images displayed. In mobile view this has been reduced to one column, 
with each service displayed as a block element, with one after the other.

### **Testimonials Page**
The testimonials page was designed using a Bootstrap carousel slider, which runs automatically showcasing customer reviews. In larger screen sizes,
a **call to action** button with the caption 'Leave a Review' has been added, this button when clicked opens a **modal dialog box** for users to write a review,
give it a star rating and submit it.

### **Contact Us Page** 
The contact us section is a two column page that includes a **contact form** on the left-hand column, and to the right, I have included the business address, opening hours
and a basic **map** image showing the location of Lomasney Motors.

### **_Existing Features_**

 **_General_**
 - The navigation bar is displayed as a fixed element, and is in view at all times on all devices, for ease of access for users it contains the company logo text as 
 a link to the hompage and navigation links to the other sections to the right.

 These icons provide links to the company Facebook page, a telephone call link and a link to google map directions.

 **_Home Page_**

 that states 'Request a Quote', which directs the user to the contact section once clicked.

 button 'Leave a Review' highlighted in yellow. This button, once clicked, opens a modal dialog box, where users can leave a review on the website if they wish to do so.
 
 **_Contact Us Section_**
 - This section has a contact form feature to the left, where users can get in touch with the company via email. It includes fields for name, email, phone no., car make, car model
 a message text area and a centered send button. To the right of the form there is some company information, which features the business address, telephone no., and opening hours.

## **Testing**
---
**Validation**
**_W3C HTML Markup Validator_**
- When I first ran this validation test there was an issue with the label for the radio buttons on the modal in the testimonials section, 
I did some research to solve this issue and found a solution on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13273806/using-the-html-label-tag-with-radio-buttons),
using the fieldset and legend elements and this solved the problem. I ran the code through the validator again and the result showed that
the HTML code was validated with no issues found in the final code.

**_W3C CSS Validator_**
- Parse Error on 32 items related to CSS Variable values from the autoprefixer used. I asked my mentor if this was an issue and after some research found that this was not an issue.
Unknown vendor extension errors on 41 items from the autoprefixer used, I ask my mentor about this and he advised me that it is not an issue.

**Tests Carried Out**

**User Story Tests**
**_As the owner I would like to provide basic services information/_**
**_As a new user, I would like to know what services they offer_**
- The website provides a section for the main services provided by the company, this will allow users to see the services on offer, and also solve the
company's request that users would be given information on the services they provide.

 **_As a new user I would like to see customer reviews of the service_**
- This objective was achieved by including a testimonial carousel slider, showing customer reviews and thoughts on the service they received. It also allows the user 
to create their own review if they wish to do so.

**_As a new user, I would like to see where they are located as I am new to the area and need to have this service close to where I live._**
- This objective was achieved by including a simple style map on the contact section, and also providing a link in the footer to google maps, giving an exact 
location of Lomasney Motors. Users can open this link to get directions to the premises. This link opens in a new tab so the user will not have to use the back button on the web browser.

**_As a potential user, I would like to be able to contact the business online as I have a very busy schedule_**
- The website includes a contact form in the contact section, that allows users to communicate via email with the company. I have also placed a call to action button on the homepage,
'Request a Quote' that links directly to the contact section. The navigation bar also includes a link to this section and once clicked will scroll to the contact form available.

**Navigation Bar**

_Navigation links_
- All navigation links when clicked should scroll directly to the section targeted.
The test was successful and all links are working correctly and scroll to the appropriate section.

_Navigation bar responsiveness_
- Verify responsiveness of navigation bar using Chrome DevTools to check if it worked across all devices.
Navigation bar was responsive across all device and collapsed into hamburger menu in tablet and mobile devices.

_Navigation Logo link_
- This link should direct the user back to the homepage.
As the navigation bar is fixed, the user should be able to retreat to the homepage at any point.
The test was successful and the navigation logo reverts the user to the homepage when it is clicked.

_Hamburger menu closing after link has been selected._
- The hamburger menu on mobile and tablet devices should automatically close once the link chosen has been selected.
The first test I discovered an issue, where the hamburger menu was opening but not closing once link was selected.
After some research I found a code snippet to solve this problem on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36405991/bootstrap-toggle-menu-on-one-page-site-does-not-uncollapse-when-clicked),
by Orel Eliyahu. I ran the test again after using the code snippet, and the test result showed that once a menu link has been selected the hamburger menu will close automatically on selection.

**Homepage**
_Hero Image Responsiveness_
- The hero image and jumbotron should be responsive and scale down to fit all devices.
I ran a test for this using DevTools on Google Chrome, to show how the site looks on different devices. I
expanded and reduced the screen size to make sure the image fits the full width of the screen on all devices.
The image and jumbotron are responsive on all devices.

_Request a Quote: Call to action_
- Check to see if the call to action button 'Request a Quote' links to the contact section when clicked.
The button takes the user directly to the contact section as intended, this test was a success.

**About Section**
 _Responsiveness of image_
- The about image should be responsive and appear on right-hand side of 'about' text in larger screens, and
appear underneath 'about' text in both tablet and mobile devices. This test was successful and the image is responsive.

**Meet the Team Section**
 _Card Responsiveness_
- In this section the cards should align side by side in larger screens and tablet devices, and on mobile devices should 
align one after the other in a block element format. This test was succesful and the card are responsive and align as expected.

**Services Section**
 _Image Responsiveness_
- The services section should have 3 columns with the images aligned side by side in larger screens and tablet devices, and
on mobile devices, should align in 1 column block elements displayed one after the other. This test was successful and images responded 
as desired.

**Testimonials Section**
_Modal Dialog Box: 'Leave a Review'_
- The button in the testimonials section 'Leave a Review', when clicked, should open a modal dialog box for the user,
to allow the user to fill in a review form to submit.
The button does as intended and no issues were found.

_Radio Button Functionality on modal dialog box_
- Tested the radio buttons to make sure only one option could be selected, no issues were found,
buttons worked as expected, only one button can be selected.

**Contact Section**
_Contact Form Validity - required fields_
- If you try to submit the form with only one of the fields complete, an error will occur
and prompt you to populate all the other required fields before the user can submit the form.
The form cannot be submitted without the required fields populated.

_Contact Form Email Validity - email valid_
- If you try to input a name into the email field instead of an email address.
An error will occur and state this is not a valid email address.

_Background Image Cover_
- I had chosen to insert a background image for the contact section that should cover the entire section, however
once I tested the background image once content had been added, I discovered an issue. It was only covering half 
of the container. I did some research and found a CSS code snippet on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/)
and in doing so was able to solve the issue by adjusting the width and height. I ran the test again and the background image
now covers the full contact section.

**Footer**
_Footer links - Directions & Facebook_
- All links should open in a new tab as the have the attribute target="_blank"
All links were tested and do open in a new tab anytime they are clicked.

_Footer Link - Phone number_
- This link should prompt the user to make a call to the phone number provided.
The test carried out was successful and the link will prompt the user to make a call, if they wish.

**General**
_Check alt text appears for all images_
- Hover over images to see if there is clear alt text visible.
All images were tested and alt text appears on images.

_Button Hover Function: darker colour_
- When any of the buttons on the site including the 'Request a Quote' on the homepage, 'Leave a Review' on the testimonials section,
'Send' button on the contact form, they should all change to a deeper colour when the mouse hovers over them.
All buttons function as expected and no issues were found.

_Conducted spell check on README file and text used in 'About' section and 'Meet the Team' sections._
- All spelling errors were corrected.

- Ran code through Autoprefixer and copied code back into css file.

- Ran code on Mobile Friendly Test page and passed all tests. The site is mobile friendly.

- I also asked friends and family members to test the website on many different devices including large screen laptops,
Iphone, android, android table and Ipad and across a variety of browsers Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Firefox.
