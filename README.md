This website is for customers, to provide up to date, relevant and easily available information about the business and the services it provides.
The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly platform that both new and existing customers can use for a range of purposes which were
identified through research, from the perspective of the business and user perspective.

### **_User Stories_**

* As the owner of Lomasney Motors, I would like to develop a stronger online presence, so that I can expand my customer base while also sustaining open communication with my existing customers.

* As the owner I would like to provide basic company and service information to cut down on the amount of time spent on the phone during the working day as we only have one other member of staff currently employed and that time needs to be spent on the services and repairs.

* As an employee, I would like to provide up to date and informative content about our services to our existing customers and attract new customers by making the business more easily accessible.

* As a new user, I would like to know more about the company and what they offer so that I can see if I would be able to develop a rapport with them as this will be a service I will need on a regular basis.

* As a new user, I would like to know what services they offer and the prices of these services.

* As a new user I would like to see customer reviews of the service and the business so that I can determine the level of quality of the service. This service is important and I need to know that the company are trustworthy and professional.

* As a new user, I would like to see where they are located as I am new to the area and need to have this service within close proximity to where I live.

* As a potential user, I would like to be able to contact the business online as I have a very busy schedule and do not have alot of free time to call.

* As a potenial user I would like to be able to book in for a service online in advance to save time.

### **_Strategy_**
My goal for this project was to design a user friendly website focused on easily accessible key information for users and 
communicate with the business online. For the business my goal was to create a online platform for the business to build brand 
awareness and showcase their work. The design was intended to be easily to navigate, simple design and plenty of vivid imagery.

### **_Scope_**
The focus of the project, given the timeframe and my current skills, was to develop a one page scrolling website with 5 main sections
that users could easily navigate and provide information that was concise and relevant, provide a means of online communication through 
the use of a contact form and review modal,and a clear description of the services provided. It was important to include a brief background 
on the company and team as it is a local business it is the personal service they offer that sets them apart from bigger companies.  

### **_Structure_**
The website is designed to entice the users through plenty of vivid images and short paprgraphs of concise, relevant information that
do not overload the user with information. The services offered are displayed as images with large captions of the service provided.
Call to action buttons are placed on 3 different sections to encourage the user to communicate if they wish to do so. The footer also 
provides external links to the Facebook page, google maps for directions and a link to the company phone number. The layout is simple,
and a fixed navigation bar allows the user to quickly navigate to any section no matter where they are on the page.

### **_Skeleton_**
It is a one-page scrolling website with 5 different sections:
- Home Page
- About Section
- Meet the Team Section
- Services Section
- Testimonial Section
- Contact Section

#### **_Wireframe mockups_**
- [Wireframes](wireframes/wireframes-alldevices.pdf)


### **_Surface_**

#### **_Colours_**
>The colour scheme chosen for this project was based around the existing logo colours used by the company.
I used a mix of different shades of green and white for the body and backgrounds. And I used a yellow colour 
for the call to action buttons so they would be vibrant and stand out as intended to.

#### **_Typography_**
>The fonts chosen for this project were Montserrat and Raleway. The Montserrat font was the closest font to the
logo which the company already have in place so it was important to keep this element throughout the website.
These fonts pair well together, are easy to read and give a professional look to the site.

#### **_Images_**
>Most of the images were created solely for the purpose of this website. These were obtained from Bazar Productions 
with some minor generic images taken from [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com) and [Pexel](https://www.pexel.com) 
where images were required for the services section.


## **Features**
---
The website was built as a one page scrolling website that includes 5 different sections.

### **Navbar & footer**
 The **navigation bar** is in a fixed position to make it easy for users to access the navigation elements of the website and allow them to 
 move from section to section as they wish. The navbar consists of **logo text** to the left which **acts as a link to the homepage** and 
 is always visible on screen. The **navigation links** are lcoated to the far right, and provide scroll links to each section. The navbar 
 is responsive and the navigation menu collapses into a **hamburger menu** for both tablet and mobile devices.
 The **footer** includes **opening hours** details and **copyright information** to the left and links to **social media**, **telephone** and **direction** 
 information on the right. I initially had both the navbar and footer fixed however  I changed this design to the footer to cut down on 
 vertical space usage as it was obstructing content.

### **Home Page**
 The Hompage was designed to be a visual display with minimal text, it includes a **hero image**, a brief description highlighting 
 the main services the company provide which is jumbotron displayed over the hero image and a **call to action button** which provides
 a link to the contact form once clicked. The idea of the homepage is to visually entice the user while not bombarding them with an 
 overload of text to consume.

### **About Page**
The About page is set up as a two column grid display with the left side displaying three small paragraphs of text detailing a brief 
history and background of the business and a full width **image** of the owner and company signage to the right. I decided to use this image 
as it represents what the company is about, a family run local garage and enhances the personal feel of the business.

### **Services Page**
The services page is a 3 column display of **images** with a text underneath stating the services the company offer. There is an image to 
represent each service with a total of 9 services and correpsonding images displayed. In mobile view this has been reduced to one column 
with each service displayed as a block element, with one after the other.

### **Testimonials Page**
The testimonials page was designed using a Bootstrap carousel slider which runs automatically showcasing customer reviews. In larger screen sizes
a **call to action** button with the caption 'Leave a Review' has been added which when clicked opens a **modal dialog box** for users to write a review,
give it a star rating and submit it.

### **Contact Us Page** 
The contact us section is a two column page that includes a **contact form** on the left hand column and to the right I have included the business address, opening hours
and a basic **map** image showing the location of Lomasney Motors.

### **_Existing Features_**

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:


In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## **Acknowledgements**
---
- My inspiration for this project came from my Dad. He is the owner of Lomasney Motors since 1987 and the business has never had a website, 
  so I thought it would be a good idea to put my skills to some real life use and build a simple yet effective website that will allow the 
  business to create a stronger online presence, expand its customer base and showcase what the services they offer.

- I would like to thank my mentor Brian Macaria for all his help and support throughout this project.

- I would also like to thank Basil Alrawi for the fantastic images he produced for this website.
